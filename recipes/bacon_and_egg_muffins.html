    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>12 slices bacon</li>
        <li>10 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced jalapeno peppers</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced roasted red peppers</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Arrange bacon on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high for 75 seconds.</li>
        <li>Line each muffin cup with one bacon slice going around the edges of the cup.</li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; spoon into muffin cups. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon green onions over four muffin cups, sprinkle 1 tablespoon jalapeno peppers over another four muffin cups, and sprinkle 1 tablespoon roasted red pepper over the remaining four muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until only slightly moist on top, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle Cheddar over muffins and continue to bake until eggs are cooked through and cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
